The Romans wrote numbers using letters : I, V, X, L, C, D, M.

**Part I**

The Kata says you should write a function to convert from normal numbers to Roman Numerals:
>
     1 --> I
     10 --> X
     7 --> VII

For a full description of how it works, take a look at [this reference website](http://www.novaroma.org/via_romana/numbers.html)

There is no need to be able to convert numbers larger than  3000.

**Part II**

Write a function to convert in the other direction, ie numeral to digit
